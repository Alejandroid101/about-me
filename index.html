    <p> <b>My autobiography</b> <br/> I was born in the <i>skirts</i> of the <i>Sierra Madre Oriental</i> mountain, in a small and hot town called Ciudad Victoria, in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico in the summer of 1991. </br> 
    Nothing really exciting happened until I was 8 years old, that's when i signed up to Karate. I quickly advanced levels by winning kata and kumite tournaments(belts) until i reached my second degree black-belt in Goju-Ryu</br> 
    style Karate-Do (same style Dwight Schrute from <i>"The Office"</i> trains). </br>
    I went to a couple of universities for 2 different engineering degrees; Mechatronics and Telematics. I was young and wanted to make money so i dropped-out and moved to Cancun to work and party. Little did i know money </br>
    doesn't come by easily to those without experience or special skills and talents. I started working as a Time-Share sales rep, but i had no experience, only a little bit of english, which ended up being enough to land the position, </br>
    but not to really make a living out of a comission-only position. I finally gave up and moved back to my hometown a year after, put on a suit and got a job in banking; I hated it.</p>
